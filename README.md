## Transfer Learning with Kernel Ridge Regression (TL-KRR)
---------------------------------------------------------

Here comes the implementation of our paper on transfer learning with kernel ridge regression, and it doesn't require finetuning the base model. 

In our experiments, we primarily tested on transferring from ResNet models pretrained on the ImageNet dataset to six downstream tasks, including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, STL10, CUB200, SVHN and Kuzushiji49.

The details of our method in four steps are presented in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.06791.pdf):

## Brief Introduction
The Implementation relies on the following files:

*TLKRR.py* is the main file that conducts our four-step transfer learning method with kernel ridge regression.

*sketched_kernels.py* sketches the feature vectors at individual layers into a fixed number of buckets.

*lowrank_feats.py* applies the NystrÃ¶m method on top of feature vectors to compute low-rank approximations.

*learning_kernel_alignment.py* computes the optimal convex combination of feature vectors from individual layers that gives the highest alignment score with the target in a downstream task.

*utils.py* has helper functions.

*cub200.py* and *kuzushiji49.py* implement the PyTorch vision dataset class for CUB200 and Kuzushiji49, respectively.
